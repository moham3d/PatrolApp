# Copilot Instructions for PatrolShield Flutter Web Admin Dashboard Development

This file guides Copilot (and all contributors) to strictly follow the 
**PatrolShield Flutter Web Dashboard Development Plan**. in 'flutter-web-development-roadmap.md' 
**No changes, omissions, or reinterpretations are permitted**â€”every detail, step, and dependency must be preserved and executed in the intended order.  
Use this checklist to track progress and ensure no task is missed or completed out of sequence.

## ðŸ“‹ Required Reading

**IMPORTANT:** Before starting any Flutter web development work, you MUST read and understand the complete backend API capabilities documented in:

**`docs/comprehensive-api-documentation.md`**

This comprehensive documentation covers:
- All 293+ backend API endpoints and their capabilities
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Request/response schemas and data structures
- Mobile API (v1) optimized endpoints (compatible with Flutter)
- Real-time communication via WebSocket (Flutter web_socket_channel)
- File management and media handling
- Error handling and rate limiting
- Integration capabilities and webhooks

Understanding these backend capabilities is essential for proper Flutter web integration and real-time feature implementation.

## ðŸŽ¯ Flutter Choice Rationale

**Why Flutter for Frontend:**
- **Superior Real-time UI Performance**: Flutter's declarative UI rebuilds efficiently with WebSocket updates
- **Unified Codebase**: Share widgets, models, and business logic between web admin and mobile apps
- **Excellent WebSocket Support**: Native `web_socket_channel` package with automatic reconnection
- **Real-time Animation**: Flutter's animation system perfect for live monitoring dashboards
- **Cross-platform Consistency**: Same UI behavior across web, iOS, and Android

## ðŸš¦ Strict Execution Rules

- **NO changes or shortcuts:** Implement each step as written.
- **NO skipping:** Do not move to the next step until the current one is complete and checked off.
- **NO reordering:** Respect all dependencies and task order.
- **NO context loss:** Always refer back to the full plan for rationale and detail.
- **Checklist discipline:** Update the checklist below immediately after completing or merging each task/PR.
- **Documentation:** Every code change must reference the exact step(s) from the plan in commit messages and PR descriptions.
- **No Hardcoded Values:** Always use backend API endpoints, environment variables, or configuration files for dynamic values. Hardcoded values are not allowed.

## ðŸ“ˆ Success Gate & Review

- All boxes must be marked as `[x]` before project is considered production-ready.
- At each phase gate (weeks 3, 6, 9, 12), conduct a full review, demo, and checklist audit.
