# Copilot Instructions for PatrolShield Flutter Mobile App Development

This file guides Copilot (and all contributors) to strictly follow the 
**PatrolShield Flutter Mobile Development Plan**. in 'flutter-mobile-development-roadmap.md' 
**No changes, omissions, or reinterpretations are permitted**â€”every detail, step, and dependency must be preserved and executed in the intended order.  
Use this checklist to track progress and ensure no task is missed or completed out of sequence.

## ðŸ“‹ Required Reading

**IMPORTANT:** Before starting any Flutter mobile development work, you MUST read and understand the complete backend API capabilities documented in:

**`backend/docs/comprehensive-api-documentation.md`**

This comprehensive documentation covers:
- All 293+ backend API endpoints and their capabilities
- **Mobile API (v1)** - specifically optimized for Flutter mobile apps with:
  - Mobile-optimized authentication with extended 24-hour tokens
  - Lightweight response schemas (â‰¤15 fields per object)
  - Flutter patrol management with GPS integration using geolocator
  - Flutter incident reporting with media capture using image_picker
  - Emergency/panic alert system with real-time broadcasting via web_socket_channel
  - Offline sync capabilities using sqflite and conflict resolution
  - Flutter performance monitoring with device performance metrics
- Real-time communication via WebSocket for live updates
- File management for evidence and media handling
- GPS tracking and location services with background processing
- Authentication and security mechanisms with flutter_secure_storage

Understanding these backend capabilities is essential for proper Flutter mobile app integration and optimal feature implementation.

## ðŸŽ¯ Flutter Choice Rationale

**Why Flutter for Mobile:**
- **Superior Real-time Performance**: Flutter's widget tree rebuilds efficiently with WebSocket updates using StreamBuilder
- **Unified Codebase**: Share models, services, and widgets between web admin and mobile apps
- **Excellent Native Integration**: Direct access to platform APIs (GPS, Camera, NFC) through platform channels
- **Outstanding Animation**: Flutter's animation system perfect for real-time location tracking and emergency alerts
- **Offline-First Architecture**: Built-in support for local databases and sync with sqflite and hive
